# Bcoin release notes & changelog

**Important: Any time you upgrade bcoin, you must execute `npm rebuild` before restarting.**

## unreleased

### Wallet changes

- A new `u` bucket is added to `txdb` that stores only spendable coins indexed by `account` and `value`.
- A new multi-algorithm coin selection. (Lowest Larger, Branch and Bound, and Single Random Draw)

#### How to upgrade

To upgrade wallet, we need to copy coins from `c` bucket to `u` bucket in `txdb`.

To do this you can run:
```
node ./migrate/walletdb7to8.js /path/to/bcoin/wallet
```

### Node API changes

#### RPC

- Added `getnodeaddresses` which returns entries from the hostlist.

### Indexer changes

- Support for multiple compact filters added as per BIP158 specification. To enable the support of multiple filters the data previously in `~/.bcoin/index/filter` has been moved to `~/.bcoin/index/filter/BASIC`.
- The filter indexer now also stores the filter hashes corresponding to the blockfilters.

#### How to upgrade

To upgrade to the multiple compact filter support we need to move filter data from `~/.bcoin/index/filter` to `~/.bcoin/index/filter/BASIC` and generate filter hashes for the existing filters.

To do this you can run:
```
node ./migrate/indexerdb0to1.js /path/to/bcoin/index
```
 
## v2.2.0

- Support for bech32m has been added. bcoin can now validate and send BTC to
addresses for witness programs with versions > 0. The address indexer has
also been updated to retrieve the new addresses. A bug was fixed where the
indexer may return data for a witness version 0 address even if a version 1
address was queried, if the two addresses had the same data (hash). After
upgrading bcoin, a full rescan may be necessary to re-index these collisions
correctly. To accomplish this:
  - Stop bcoin (`bcoin-cli rpc stop` or `ctrl-C`)
  - Delete the existing addr indexer data (`rm -rf ~/.bcoin/index/addr`)
  - Restart bcoin
  - The address indexer will automatically begin re-indexing the chain. It may take up to 24 hours.

- The logging module `blgr` has been updated. Log files will now be rolled over
at around 20 MB and timestamped. Only the last 10 log files will be kept on disk
and older log files will be purged. These values can be configured by passing
`--log-max-file-size` (in MB) and `--log-max-files`.

## v2.1.2

- Fixed wallet RPC method `importprunedfunds`.

## v2.1.1

- Fixed a bug with the wallet 'conflict' event.

## v2.1.0

- Added an endpoint to the wallet HTTP API at `GET /` for an aliveness check.
  It returns the current `version` and `network` type.

## v2.0.0

### How to upgrade

The way that block data is stored has changed for greater performance,
efficiency, reliability and portability.

- Block and undo block data has been moved from LevelDB into flat files.
- The transaction and address indexes have been moved into separate
  LevelDB databases.
- The transaction index has been de-duplicated, and will reduce disk usage by
  half for those running with `txindex` enabled.
- The `txindex` and `addrindex` can now be enabled after the initial
  block download.
- The `addrindex` has been sorted to support querying for large sets
  of results, and will no longer cause CPU and memory exhaustion issues.
- The `addrindex` will correctly distinguish between `p2pkh` and
  `p2wpkh` addresses.
- BIP158 compact block filters can be computed and indexed (`filterindex`).

To upgrade to the new disk layout it's necessary to move block data
from LevelDB (e.g. `~/.bcoin/chain`) to a new file-based block
storage (e.g. `~/.bcoin/blocks`), and remove `txindex` and `addrindex`
data from the chain database, for those that have that feature enabled.

To do this you can run:
```
node ./migrate/chaindb4to6.js /path/to/bcoin/chain
```

The migration will take 1-3 hours, depending on hardware. The block data
will now be stored at `/path/to/bcoin/blocks`. After the data has been moved
the chain database will be compacted to free disk space.

Alternatively, you can also sync the chain again, however the above
migration will be faster as additional network bandwidth won't be used
for re-downloading the blocks.

For those with `txindex` and `addrindex` enabled, the indexes will be
regenerated by rescanning the chain on next startup. This process can
take multiple hours (e.g. 8 hours) depending on hardware and the
index. Please take the potential downtime in re-indexing into account
before upgrading.


### Client API changes

- Client module `/lib/client` was created from the external dependency `bclient`.
- `NodeClient` method `estimateFee` now returns JSON instead of a number.
- Added `fee` command to `bcoin-cli`.
- Added `getBlockHeader` to `NodeClient` and corresponding `header` command to CLI.
- Added `getFilter` to `NodeClient` and corresponding `filter` command to CLI.

### Wallet API changes

#### HTTP

- `PUT /wallet/:id` Creating a watch-only wallet now requires an `accountKey`
  argument. This is to prevent bcoin from generating keys and addresses the
  user can not spend from.
- `POST /wallet/:id/create`
  - Now has a `sign` argument for optional signing of transactions.
  - Now has a `template` option, that will skip templating inputs when
  `sign = false`, but you can enable it if necessary. It does not have an
  effect when `sign = true`.
  - Exposes `blocks`, which will be used for fee estimation if `rate` is not set.
  - Exposes `sort` (Default `true`), that can be used to disable BIP69 sorting.

#### RPC

- Bug fix addresses for the `getnewaddress` command with various networks.
- Deprecate the `ismine` and `iswatchonly` fields from the `validateaddress`
  command and add `isscript`, `iswitness`, `ischange`, `witness_version`
  and `witness_program` to partially match the v0.18.0 Bitcoin Core release
  (26a2000b0177fd2668b7d82e5aa52829cf2bfdf6)
- Add wallet RPC `getaddressinfo` to return `ismine` and `iswatchonly`
  with the correct values instead of their previous values which were
  hard-coded to `false`. Also returns `address`, `scriptPubKey`, `isscript`,
  `iswitness`, `witness_version` and `witness_program`.
  (a28ffa272a3c4d90d0273d9aa223a23becc08e0e)

### Node API changes

#### HTTP

Several CPU and memory exhaustion issues have been resolved with some
additional arguments for querying multiple sets of results for addresses
that have many transactions.

- `GET /tx/address/:address` has several new arguments: `after`, `reverse`
  and `limit`. The `after` argument is a txid, for querying additional results
  after a previous result. The `reverse` argument will change the order that
  results are returned, the default order is oldest to latest. The `limit`
  argument can be used to give results back in smaller sets if necessary.
- `POST /tx/address` has been deprecated. Instead, query for each address
  individually with `GET /tx/address/:address` with the expectation that
  there could be _many_ results that would additionally need to be queried
  in a subsequent query using the `after` argument to request the next set.
- `POST /coin/address` and `GET /coin/address/:address` are deprecated as
  coins can be generated using results from `/tx/address/:address` and
  querying by only a range of the latest transactions to stay synchronized.
  Coins could otherwise be removed from results at any point, and thus the
  entire set of results would need to be queried every time to discover
  which coins have been spent and are currently available.
- `GET /` has new fields `.indexes.{addr,tx,filter}` for the status of indexers.

#### RPC

- Both `getblock` and `getblockheader` return `bits` in base 16 as a string
  instead of base 10 and a number.

### Network changes

- Regtest params have been updated to correspond with other bitcoin
  implementations for cross-testing. Key prefixes have been updated and
  SegWit is always active (39684df6051b599da9ed1383cb7e3f8605806a74). The
  regtest seeds have also been cleared so that the node will not attempt
  to connect to itself.
- Testnet seeds have been updated (8b6eba165b090edfc1ff5dbc9c422758d60b6342)

### Logging changes

- Wallet and node HTTP and RPC is now more clearly identified. The wallet
  HTTP server will log with the context `wallet-http` and the RPC as
  `wallet-rpc`. The node HTTP will log with the context `node-http` and the
  RPC as `node-rpc`. There was also a reduction in the duplicate logs in
  the case of an error for the node RPC, and the addition of method logging
  for the wallet RPC.
- There is now also additional logging during wallet rescans.

### Configuration changes

- Pool options now has a `--discover` option exposed, and the `--only` node
  option will disable discovery of new nodes.
- The option for `coin-cache` has been removed. This setting was causing
  issues during sync with out-of-memory errors and was making performance
  worse instead of better.
- The database location for indexes can be configured via the
  `--index-prefix` option. Default locations are `prefix` + `/index`
  (e.g. `~/.bcoin/testnet/index/tx` and `~/.bcoin/testnet/index/addr`).

### Script changes

- Script has been updated for policy flags. For example
  `VERIFY_CONST_SCRIPTCODE` to disable `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in non-SegWit
  scripts and make a positive `findAndDelete` result invalid.
- SegWit scripts that terminate with a stack size not equal to one
  now have an error of `CLEANSTACK` instead of `EVAL_FALSE`.
- `VERIFY_UPGRADABLE_NOPS` now does not apply to `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`
  and `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`.

### Testing changes

- Switched to use a security-focused rewrite of `mocha` called
  `bmocha`, for further details see: https://github.com/bcoin-org/bmocha
- Data has been updated to be in sync with other implementations
  around policy-only script validation.
- Tests now cleanly close with all timers being cleared.
- Configuration file `wallet.conf` won't be read during test runs, which was
  causing issues with some testing environments.

### Chain changes

- The transaction index methods are now implemented at `node.txindex`:
  - `getMeta(hash)`
  - `getTX(hash)`
  - `hasTX(hash)`
  - `getSpentView(tx)`
- The address index method `getHashesByAddress` is now implemented
  at `node.addrindex`:
  - `getHashesByAddress(addr)` It now accepts `Address` instances
    rather than `Address|String` and the results are now sorted in
    order of appearance in the blockchain.
  - `getHashesByAddress(addr, options)` A new options argument has
    been added with the fields:
    - `after` - A transaction hash for results to begin after.
    - `limit` - The total number of results to return at maximum.
    - `reverse` - Will give results in order of latest to oldest.
- The following methods require `node.addrindex.getHashesByAddress`
  in conjunction with `node.txindex.getTX` and `node.txindex.getMeta`
  respectively, and now includes a new options argument as described
  above for `getHashesByAddress`:
  - `node.getMetaByAddress(addr, options)`
  - `node.getTXByAddress(addr, options)`
- The following method has been deprecated:
  - `getCoinsByAddress(addr)`

### Other changes

- A new module for storing block data in files.
- Use of `buffer-map` for storing hashes
  (see https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin/issues/533).
- Use of `bsert` for assertions.
- `SIGINT` handling will close the full node, spvnode and wallet.
- Using the bcoin library in a REPL now has auto-completion by pressing tab.
- Various documentation updates.
- Mempool fix to add non-standard (non-SegWit) to reject cache.
- Dependencies are committed to the repository and bcoin does
  not depend on npm.
- Updates to dependencies including `bcrypto` to version > 5.
- Various small fixes to run bcoin in a browser.

## v1.0.0

### Migration

The latest bcoin release contains almost a total rewrite of the wallet. A
migration is required.

Bcoin has also been modularized quite a bit. Users installing globally from npm
should be sure to run:

``` bash
$ npm update -g bcoin
```

For users who cloned the respository themselves, it might be wise to simply
remove the `node_modules` directory and do a fresh `npm install`.

``` bash
$ cd bcoin/
$ git pull origin master
$ rm -rf node_modules/
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

---

Once upgrading is complete, a migration script must be executed. The migration
script resides in `./migrate/latest` as an executable file.

A bcoin __prefix directory__ must be passed as the first argument.

Example:

``` bash
$ ./migrate/latest ~/.bcoin
```

What this does:

- Renames `chain.ldb` to `chain`.
- Renames `spvchain.ldb` to `spvchain`.
- Renames `walletdb.ldb` to `wallet`.
- Runs a migration (`chaindb3to4.js`) on `chain`.
- Runs a migration (`chaindb3to4.js`) on `spvchain`.
- Runs a migration (`walletdb6to7.js`) on `wallet`.

The chain migration should be minor, and only taxing if you have
`--index-address` enabled.

If you have a testnet, regtest, or simnet directory, the migration must also be
run on these, e.g.

``` bash
$ ./migrate/latest ~/.bcoin/testnet
```

Also note that the `--prefix` argument now __always__ creates a fully-fledged
prefix directory. For example `--prefix ~/.bcoin_whatever --network testnet`
will create a directory structure of `~/.bcoin_whatever/testnet/` instead of
`~/.bcoin_whatever`. Please update your directory structure accordingly.

### Configuration changes

Wallet and Node are now separated and use different persistent configuration files.
Some configuration options have moved to `wallet.conf`, which is stored in the prefix
directory next to the existing `bcoin.conf`.

All configuration options in `wallet.conf` will have the `wallet-`
prefix added implicitly. The prefix is still needed when using CLI/ENV configuration
methods. The wallet now has it's own HTTP server, so options such as
`wallet-http-host` must also be specified along with `http-host`
if you require this setting (required for Docker networking).

Wallet-specific settings such as `api-key` and `wallet-auth`
have moved to `wallet.conf`. If using CLI/ENV options, these are prefixed with `wallet-`.
Various configuration method examples are shown below.
Note some config options (eg. `network`) are automatically passed to wallet plugin
if specified through CLI/ENV, but should be specified in `wallet.conf` for `bwallet-cli`.

Example using wallet.conf:
```
network: testnet
wallet-auth: true
api-key: hunter2
http-host: 0.0.0.0
```

Example using CLI options:
`./bin/node --network=testnet --http-host=0.0.0.0 --wallet-http-host=0.0.0.0 --wallet-api-key=hunter2 --wallet-wallet-auth=true`

Example using ENV:
`BCOIN_NETWORK=simnet BCOIN_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 BCOIN_WALLET_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 BCOIN_WALLET_API_KEY=hunter2 BCOIN_WALLET_WALLET_AUTH=true ./bin/node`

### Bcoin client changes

The `bcoin cli` interface has been deprecated and is now replaced with a
separate tool: `bcoin-cli`. `bcoin wallet` has also been deprecated and is
replaced with `bwallet-cli`. Both `bcoin-cli` and `bwallet-cli` can be
installed with the `bclient` package in npm.

### Wallet API changes

The main wallet API changes have to do with changes in the structure of the
HTTP server itself. The bcoin wallet HTTP server will now always listen on it's
own port. Standard ports are:

```
main: 8334
testnet: 18334
regtest: 48334
simnet: 18558
```

The default account object is no longer present on the wallet. To retrieve it,
request `/wallet/:id/account/default` instead. More minor changes to the JSON
output include the removal of `id` and `wid` properties on a number of objects.
Please update your code accordingly.

For socket.io events, all `wallet ` prefixes have been removed. For example,
`wallet join` should be replaced with simply `join`. All wallet-related events
(`tx`, `confirmed`, etc) now receive the wallet ID as the first argument. The
`tx` event will receive `[id, details]` instead of `[details]`.

The `_admin` endpoints have been moved up a level. Instead of requesting
`/wallet/_admin/backup` (for example), request `/backup` instead. If
`--wallet-auth` is enabled, a new flag `--admin-token` is accepted. Admin token
is a 64 character hex string and allows access to all admin routes. For
example, `GET /backup?token=xxx...`. It also allows access to any wallet on the
HTTP or websocket layer (websockets who use the admin token can join a wallet
of `*`, which notifies them of events on _all_ wallets).

### Notable changes

- __wallet/http__ - A `conflict` event will be correctly emitted for _all_
  double spends.
- __wallet/http__ - Account balances are now indexed and will appear on account
  objects via the API.
- __bcoin__ - Bcoin has been rewritten using class syntax. Objects will not be
  inheritable with legacy prototypal inheritance.
- __pkg__ - Bcoin is once again buildable with browserify.
- __pkg__ - Numerous modules have been moved out to separate dependencies. For
  example, the `lib/crypto` module has been moved to the `bcrypto` package (and
  also heavily optimized even further).
- __bcoin__ - The main `bcoin` module has been rewritten in terms of what it
  exposes and how. Conventions have changed (`Address` instead of `address`).
  Due to the use of class syntax, something like `bcoin.Address(str)` is no
  longer possible. Please take a look at `lib/bcoin.js` to get a better idea of
  what has changed.
- __net__ - Support for BIP151 and BIP150 has been dropped.

## v1.0.0-beta.15

### Notable changes

## v1.0.0-beta.14

### Notable changes

- __pkg__ - Ignored `bcoin*` files in npmignore have been removed. This fixes
  the npm install.

## v1.0.0-beta.13

### Notable changes

- __config__ - Options using megabyte units are now calculated properly again
  (6182df044228f9215938e7d314435f3f2640acca,
  a630d23a97b68f189a85105856fedc4e9e515754,
  7728a0047053d4c368e60426e5fc7cc812d54caf).

- __address__ - Bech32 addresses are now supported
  (6acef06cbc87a3051ba238a2fb640562e718135e). This changes the semantics of
  the `Address` object: to support bech32, `Address.fromBase58` calls should be
  replaced with `Address.fromString`.  Likewise, `addr.toBase58` calls should
  be replaced with `addr.toString`

- __rpc__ - `getblockbyheight` is now exposed via JSON-RPC. It takes the same
  parameters as the `getblock` call, requiring a height instead of block hash
  (12d3ee6f9582afa9a3ba8984c63dcbc27b8db57e).

- __bin__ - `bcoin --version` and `bcoin --help` now exit with appropriate
  messages (f2f94a800e37c5dbdda6920fa6b85fbd485c212a).

- __net__ - The p2p pool now exposes an `--only` option
  (a1d0948f2e528c5d77d6502659fafd064b1e693b).

- __mempool__ - The mempool `indexAddress` option should now work correctly
  (fba9b46d253c19bbf8e662d9d75ab03dc9e20a78).

- __rpc__ - JSON-RPC calls now properly cast booleans a la bitcoin core
  (dd49ee076196d2353783e3044185165dbac4aeb9).

- __rpc__ - Various RPC calls have been improved and updated
  (c78707ed6a71ce46c41c4e43ecb505e78a84b380,
  c1e684dc12d0a86573a905d54d4f81fce921987a,
  5bde338a53117b1bd0fd92df0abc23d95180ab32).

- __rpc__ - Retroactive pruning is now available via the `pruneblockchain` call
  (f0bc6d5925419ba4a8289fa7828efc48ecc152d4).

- __http__ - Getting block by height via the Rest API now works again
  (df4c8cc68c965bd818a5004354d2652751d4a702).

- __net__ - Peers who serve invalid orphans are now punished properly
  (0ceca23cb5a3d724c79c6bf587ede5d473df8486).

- __utils__ - An implementation of GCS filters is now supported
  (b994c278f25408886c3095d0c24123baaf07f78f).

- __http__ - The `witness` option is now properly exposed on the Rest API for
  segwit wallets (f04ad612b216becd35765c6e231f7820c7eee358).

- __deps__ - Node.js >=v7.6.0 is now a required dependency
  (a0bd9680fed07c5eb37c227d160b0868f8adaf31).

- __build__ - The browser build has switched from browserify to webpack
  (19f236f74072d473123d20282d2119f6d9130458).

- __bcoin__ - The codebase has been rewritten to use all ES6 and ES7 features
  supported by node.js
  (aa05bb5df79d9a3af53060a4c0c066226f6e9e4c,
  78d62c73b82e1953999d1cf80c90ed2035d4996e,
  e00472891df5934d8fc3aa63662f852816aa86b0,
  c53f4cf89e46d9de8ab7f65430310567558fe03f,
  8c7279518f5341a2482a79ac98f0574468541edc).

- __workers__ - The worker pool has been refactored to solve the dissonance
  between the browser and node.js (27c60ce76e57af1695d78f912227d93194812c88).

- __net__ - DNS requests should now timeout sooner
  (647b6909c6d527eb82f6d789c88a23b2f8a60126).

- __http__ - Satoshi values are now required for all JSON serialization, as
  opposed to BTC strings which were used in the past
  (2f51fd1c5066f194a5a52383f4dd45497b882706).

- __bin__ - The `--no-wallet` flag is now exposed for nodes who want to run
  without a wallet.

- __chain__ - BIP91 support is now exposed via the `--bip91` option.  The
  `segwit` and `segsignal` rules will be automatically added when calling
  `getblocktemplate`. To enable bip91 on an existing database `--force-flags`
  must be passed. This will force bip91 to be enforced, but will not invalidate
  any previous blocks (`bcoin cli reset [height]` may need to be used).

- __chain__ - BIP148 support is now exposed via the `--bip148` option. This
  likewise must be enabled with `--force-flags` on existing chains. This has
  the same potential "reset" implications as the `--bip91` option.

### Migrating

This release contains a few non-backward-compatible changes.

Bcoin now requires node.js >=7.6.0 due to the use of ES6/7 features, and for
the sake of more stability.

Bcoin's rest API now assumes satoshi values for in all JSON serialization.
__This is a breaking change__ for code that is not aware of it. All code which
hits the rest API must be updated to use only satoshi values as opposed to BTC
strings.

In other words, this:

``` json
{
  "unconfirmed": "1.12",
  "confirmed": "1.12"
}
```

Becomes this:

``` json
{
  "unconfirmed": 112000000,
  "confirmed": 112000000
}
```
